### Hi, I'm Bill!

A little about me
-
I'm a Master's of Computer Science student at the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign🌽([UIUC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Illinois_Urbana-Champaign)). I did my Bachelor's here as well, graduting in 3 years, and I studied [Statistics📊 and CS💻](https://cs.illinois.edu/academics/undergraduate/degree-program-options/bs-statistics-computer-science).

I grew up in 上海 Shanghai, China 🇨🇳.

I'm most interested in systems and low level software development, such as infrastructure, compilers, distributed systems, and high frequency trading. I also like learning about algorithms and do a bit of [competitive coding](https://codeforces.com/profile/billJZ)🧑‍💻.
